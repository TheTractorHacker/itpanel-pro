# ITFlow Quick Ticket (Windows)

A lightweight Windows tray app that lets end users submit an ITFlow support
ticket — with an optional full-screen screenshot — in a few clicks, with no
portal login.

## How it works

1. Runs in the system tray, starting on login.
2. Click the tray icon (or "New Ticket") to open a small popup:
   - Subject
   - Description
   - "Attach Screenshot" (captures the full screen, shows a thumbnail,
     can be retaken or removed)
3. "Submit" posts the ticket to ITFlow via the API, then the window closes
   after a brief success message.

## ITFlow API call

```
POST {itflow_base_url}/api/v1/tickets?api_key={api_key}
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

subject=...
details=...
client_id=...
contact_id=...      (optional)
priority=Medium
file=@screenshot.png (optional)
```

This requires ITFlow **v2.11.32 or later**, which added multipart/form-data
support (with an optional `file`/`files[]` attachment) to ticket creation —
see `agent` repo commit "API: support file attachments on ticket creation,
replies, and unify attachment storage". On older versions, ticket creation
only accepts a JSON body and has no attachment support.

The `api_key` is a **legacy API key** (Admin > API Keys in ITFlow). Note:

- It must be sent as a `?api_key=` query string parameter — for
  multipart/form-data POST bodies, the JSON-body fallback does not apply.
- The legacy key authenticates as the first active admin user (ITFlow does
  not currently scope legacy-key requests to `api_key_client_id`); the
  `client_id` field in `config.json` is what actually assigns the ticket
  to the right client.
- Treat the API key as a shared secret across all machines it's deployed
  to — anyone with it can create tickets for any client via this endpoint.

## Files

- `tray_app.py` — the application (pystray + tkinter + Pillow + requests)
- `config.json` — config template, deployed to
  `%ProgramData%\ITFlowQuickTicket\config.json`
- `itflow_quick_ticket.spec` — PyInstaller spec, produces a single
  windowed `.exe` (no console)
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
- `deploy/deploy_quickticket.ps1` — TacticalRMM deployment script (silently
  runs the installer with per-client config)
- `assets/icon.ico` — branded tray/installer icon
- `../installer/ITFlowQuickTicket.iss` — Inno Setup script that builds the
  configurable installer
- `../.github/workflows/build.yml` — CI: builds the exe + installer on
  every push, and attaches both to a GitHub release for tags `v*`

## Getting a build

### Option A: GitHub Actions (no Windows machine needed)

Push a tag like `v1.0.0` (or just push to `master` / run the workflow
manually) and GitHub Actions will build on a `windows-latest` runner and
upload:

- `ITFlowQuickTicket.exe` — the bare tray app
- `ITFlowQuickTicketSetup.exe` — the full installer (recommended)

For tag pushes (`v*`), both files are also attached to a GitHub release.

### Option B: Build locally on Windows

```powershell
cd Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
pyinstaller itflow_quick_ticket.spec
# Output: Windows\dist\ITFlowQuickTicket.exe

# Then build the installer (requires Inno Setup 6: https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php)
cd ..\installer
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" ITFlowQuickTicket.iss
# Output: installer\Output\ITFlowQuickTicketSetup.exe
```

To rebrand the tray icon, replace `Windows/assets/icon.ico` (also used as
the installer icon) before building.

## Installer (`ITFlowQuickTicketSetup.exe`)

Running the installer prompts for the ITFlow connection settings (base URL,
API key, Client ID, Contact ID, Priority) on a dedicated wizard page, then:

- Installs `ITFlowQuickTicket.exe` to `C:\Program Files\ITFlowQuickTicket`
- Writes `C:\ProgramData\ITFlowQuickTicket\config.json` from the entered
  values
- Adds a shortcut to the All Users Startup folder so it launches on every
  login
- Offers to launch the app immediately

### Unattended / silent install

All wizard fields can be supplied as command-line parameters, which also
pre-fill the wizard if shown:

```
ITFlowQuickTicketSetup.exe /VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART ^
  /ItflowBaseUrl=https://itflow.foleyit.com ^
  /ApiKey=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ^
  /ClientId=5 ^
  /ContactId=12 ^
  /Priority=Medium
```

## Deploying via TacticalRMM

1. Get `ITFlowQuickTicketSetup.exe` from a GitHub release (Option A above)
   and host it somewhere TacticalRMM can download it from — the direct
   release asset URL works fine, e.g.:

   ```
   https://github.com/TheTractorHacker/itflow-quick-ticket/releases/latest/download/ITFlowQuickTicketSetup.exe
   ```

2. In TacticalRMM, add `deploy/deploy_quickticket.ps1` as a script (type
   **PowerShell**, run as **System**), then set its **Script Arguments**
   to a single line per client, e.g.:

   ```
   -InstallerUrl "https://github.com/TheTractorHacker/itflow-quick-ticket/releases/latest/download/ITFlowQuickTicketSetup.exe" -ItflowBaseUrl "https://itflow.foleyit.com" -ApiKey "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" -ClientId 5 -ContactId 12 -Priority "Medium"
   ```

   | Argument | Value |
   |----------|-------|
   | `-InstallerUrl`  | URL to `ITFlowQuickTicketSetup.exe` (above) |
   | `-ItflowBaseUrl` | e.g. `https://itflow.foleyit.com` |
   | `-ApiKey`        | API key from Admin > API Keys |
   | `-ClientId`      | ITFlow `client_id` for this client |
   | `-ContactId`     | (optional) ITFlow `contact_id`, omit or use `0` |
   | `-Priority`      | (optional) `Low` / `Medium` / `High` / `Critical`, default `Medium` |

   This downloads and silently runs the installer with those settings,
   which installs the app, writes `config.json`, and sets up the Startup
   shortcut — then launches the app for the current session if one exists.

### Upgrading

Running the same installer again (manually, or by re-running the
TacticalRMM script above) upgrades an existing install in place: it closes
the running tray app, replaces the exe, and restarts it — no uninstall
step needed. If you don't pass connection settings on an upgrade run, the
existing `config.json` values are kept automatically.

## Config reference (`config.json`)

| Field                  | Required | Description                                  |
|------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `itflow_base_url`      | yes      | e.g. `https://itflow.foleyit.com`              |
| `api_key`               | yes      | Legacy API key from Admin > API Keys           |
| `client_id`             | yes      | ITFlow `client_id` this install belongs to     |
| `contact_id`            | no       | ITFlow `contact_id` to attach to the ticket    |
| `priority`              | no       | `Low` / `Medium` / `High` / `Critical` (default `Medium`) |
| `include_system_info`   | no       | Auto-attach hostname/OS/user/local IP to ticket details (default `true`) |
| `check_for_updates`     | no       | Silently check GitHub for newer releases on startup (default `true`) |
| `accent_color`          | no       | Hex color (e.g. `"#16a34a"`) to re-brand the accent color used in the New Ticket window |
| `branding_logo`         | no       | Absolute path to a `.png` to use as the tray icon and window header logo instead of the default ITFlow icon |

The installer only prompts for the first five fields above; the branding
fields are optional and can be added by hand-editing `config.json` after
install (or templating it in your own deployment scripts).

### Other new features (v1.4.0+)

- **Asset auto-link** — the hostname of the machine is sent with every
  ticket and matched against the client's Assets in ITFlow (by Asset Name
  or Asset Tag) to set the ticket's linked asset automatically.
- **Ticket categories** — if the ITFlow instance has Ticket-type categories
  configured, a Category dropdown appears in the New Ticket window.
- **File attachments** — in addition to the screenshot tool, users can
  attach any file (log, error dialog export, etc.) via "Attach File".
- **Offline queue** — if the ITFlow server is unreachable when a ticket is
  submitted, it's saved locally and retried automatically every 5 minutes.
- **My Recent Tickets** — tray menu item showing this install's recent
  tickets and their current status.
- **Status-change notifications** — a desktop notification is shown when a
  ticket submitted from this device changes status.
- **Quick Tools** — tray menu submenu with one-click troubleshooting: show
  this machine's public IP, ping google.com, list installed printers, and
  restart the print spooler service (the last one may require running the
  app as Administrator).
